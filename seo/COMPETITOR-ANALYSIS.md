## Direct Competitor Deep-Dive

### 1. winetourslanzarote.com — #1 Wine Competitor
- **Top rankings:** Lanzarote vineyards (#3), lanzarote winery (#4), lanzarote wine (#5), wine tasting lanzarote (#1)
- **Weakness:** Only focused on wine. No broader experience offerings. Ranks for wine-specific terms only.
- **Price point:** Standard group tours (max 8 people). Not luxury/exclusive.
- **Our opportunity:** They don't do *private* or *exclusive* bodega experiences. Differentiate with non-commercial bodegas they don't cover.

### 2. excursionslanzarote.com — General Excursion Competitor
- **Top rankings:** Rancho Texas Lanzarote (#3), lanzarote attractions (#7), things to see (#15), Puerto del Carmen (#13)
- **Strength:** Broad coverage of ALL Lanzarote activities. High traffic from general terms.
- **Weakness:** Mass-market tours, not luxury/exclusive. No wine/culinary focus. No premium positioning.
- **Our opportunity:** They go wide, we go deep + premium. They can't compete on "unique" or "private" experiences.

### 3. Travel Blogs Ranking Well
- heatheronhertravels.com (#2 for "things to do"), wanderlustchloe.com (#7), wanderingnomada.com (#8)
- **Opportunity:** Partner with these bloggers for backlinks/reviews. They rank high but don't sell tours.

## Competitor Gaps = Our Opportunities

| Gap | Evidence | Our Play |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| **No luxury/exclusive player exists** | No competitor positions themselves as luxury/premium | Own the "luxury lanzarote experiences" space entirely |
| **"Hidden gems" poorly served** | Only blogs rank (#3 thelifeofasocialbutterfly, #4 tripadvisor). No experience provider ranks top 5 | Create the definitive "hidden gems" experience page |
| **Private tours barely exist** | "Lanzarote private tour" shows mainly GetYourGuide/Viator generic results | Build dedicated private tour landing pages |
| **Non-commercial bodegas = untapped** | winetourslanzarote.com visits commercial vineyards (La Geria, Rubicón, El Grifo). No one promotes private/artisan bodegas | Differentiate with exclusive access to family bodegas |
| **No multilingual competitor** | excursionslanzarote.com has some Spanish, but no competitor does DE+FR well | Win DE and FR markets with proper localised content |
| **Fishing experiences underserved** | 170 searches/mo, mostly TripAdvisor results | Create compelling fishing experience content |
