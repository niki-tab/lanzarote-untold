# Article Writer Brief: "Hidden Gems of Lanzarote"

## Context

Writing for **Lanzarote Untold** — a luxury travel agency in Lanzarote (Canary Islands, Spain) offering exclusive, private experiences with locals. NOT a budget tour operator. Targets affluent travellers who want authentic, off-the-beaten-path experiences: private family bodegas, fishing with local fishermen, exploring secret spots only residents know.

**Brand voice:** Sophisticated but warm. Insider knowledge. Not pretentious — more like a well-connected friend who knows the real Lanzarote. Avoid generic travel blog cliches.

**Target audience:** Affluent UK, German, French, and Spanish travellers planning a Lanzarote trip who want unique experiences, not the standard tourist circuit.
